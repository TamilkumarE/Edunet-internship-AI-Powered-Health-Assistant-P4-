# AI-Powered-Health-Assistant-P4-Project
An advanced AI-powered health assistant that analyzes symptoms, provides medical advice, and helps users monitor their well-being with intelligent diagnostics and personalized recommendations. ðŸš€ðŸ’¡
The AI-Powered Health Assistant Chatbot has demonstrated the potential of natural language processing (NLP) in enhancing accessibility to preliminary healthcare information. By leveraging Hugging Faceâ€™s DistilGPT-2, the chatbot generates contextually relevant and human-like responses to user queries. This project highlights the following insights:
Effective Use of NLP: Implementing pipeline("text-generation", model="distilgpt2") has allowed the chatbot to provide coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
User Engagement: The text-based interaction format ensures ease of use, encouraging
users to seek basic health information without hesitation.
Limitations: Despite its utility, the chatbot is limited to providing general health advice and cannot replace professional medical consultations. It also lacks real-time contextual understanding and personalization.
